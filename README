This set of scripts checks the keycodes emitted by the Yubikey for many
keyboard layouts so the Yubikey can work for more people.

If you can't type on the us qwerty keyboard, edit RESTORE_LAYOUT in
buildalphabetinfo.py.

Type 'make' in an X11 console and wait. Don't try to type while it's
gathering data; it's changing your keybord layout and you won't get the
letters you expect.

alphabets.txt is the important data, these are the analogs of the modhex
characters, one alphabet per line, in utf-8.

modhexmap.js is the (alphabets, reverse_index) structure used for modhex.js

modhex.js will be regenerated with your detected alphabets.
